title: About
---

As a full-stack web developer, I love tackling challenges and always strive to continually acheive and pursue anything and everything that I get passionate about. I love listening to and playing (relatively) difficult piano pieces. In the next one year, I'm eager to strengthen myself as a developer, learn to box, discover new and rediscover old meaningful friendships, pick up my guitar, and win a tournament in badminton.
