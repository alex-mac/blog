This is the first post from myself to myself and to other asipring for the same dream. I want this blog to help others learn the lessons that I have had to learn on this amazing journey called life and about some pretty sweet features that I've learned along the way!

The first thing that we need to learn is that it's okay to fail. 

Okay, so I'm sure you guys are thinking "Hey man, everyone says that, I already know that" but wait, let me elaborate. People say it all the time, but what does it really mean? I grew up in a household that probably resemble 100% of second generation (first born) Asian-Americans. I'm not even kidding. If you're an Asian-American, I'm sure your parents had the same dreams for you as they did for me. "Get good grades, go to college, and become a doctor/pharmacist/something-that makes-a-lot-of-money." I don't know about what it's like for other cultures but I'm certain that many of you have felt a similar pressure growing up to succeed. I was afraid to fail, to disappoint my parents. 

I want to let you guys know that you're not alone, and that I've been there. I've felt the same pressure and pursued a major in college that would please my parents without thinking about what I wanted because it was just easier to follow what they wanted rather than to put my heart and ambitions on the line. I simply wanted a peaceful life making enough money to be happy. I didn't want to worry about money. 

The truth is, you need to make enough money to not worry about money. Otherwise, money is ALWAYS going to be something that you're going to worry about.

Whether you're afraid to fail because you don't want to let down others or you're afraid to fail because society and media have brainwashed us that successful people are the ones that everyone's eyes are upon, don't get discouraged. It might be now, it might be later, but TRUST me. You will become someone's inspiration, and someone else will become your inspiration. You don't need to be famous to inspire someone. You're great the way you are and I'm positive that you are going to succeed so hard when you find what you're passionate about. You don't need to search for it, let things happen naturally. You'll know what it is when you find it. The feeling is so starkly different that there's no mistaking it. This is the best way to find something that you love and to genuinely pursue it like I have. 

I have a Bachelors in Science in Biology. I'm pursuing a career where I can code and solve interesting problems all day long. My parents may or may not consider me a failure compared to their friend's kids, but it doesn't matter. It's okay to fail. It is in failure that we realize what's important. I'm not great with my words, but I will be one day.
